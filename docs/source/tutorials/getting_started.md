# Getting started

The Crop Master is a python package created for digital agriculture. For now, the core of
this package is to process the relationship between farm, field and image.

- Farm: farm can be considered as a collection of fields, and a farm can have many fields.
- Field: field is a field planted with crops
- Image: image is a remote sensing image, which can be satellite image or drone image.

There are many useful packages which can be used for anlysis remote sensing image, but they
usually don't consider the relationship between farm, field and image. This package is created
to solve this problem.
