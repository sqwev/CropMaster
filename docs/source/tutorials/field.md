# Field
The Field class is a field, which can be defined by polygon/multipolygon or raster image, 
or only by an index.

The Field object has public properties and private properties, 
the public properties are the properties that are scalable, which can be
easily used in geoDataFrame, and the private properties are the properties
that are not scalable.


## Plot the field

```python
field.plot()
```
